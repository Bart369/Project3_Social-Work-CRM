# Project3

## DESCRIPTION
Our project is a student resource dashboard for Per Scholas, a nonprofit organization based in the 
South Bronx. The objective is to help the social worker at Per Scholas more efficiently offer guidance, 
suggest referrals, and follow up with individual students according to their needs. 
Students will be able to register for an account on this website to access resources, 
check off to-doâ€™s, and schedule an appointment.
